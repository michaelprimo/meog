## Habemus Logo!

Hello everyone! This post is dedicated to the creation and final selection of the Meog logo.

The logo needed to reflect the dual nature of the project: **growth** and **code**.

### The Design Process

We explored several concepts, focusing on:
1.  **A clean, minimalist aesthetic** to match the website design.
2.  **A dynamic element** to symbolize the "metablog that grows."

The final choice combines a geometric shape, representing the structure and stability of code, with an upward-pointing arrow, symbolizing growth and continuous learning.

### Next Steps

Now that the visual identity is complete, we're focusing on the component development in React.
