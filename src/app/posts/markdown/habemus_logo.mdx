## Habemus Logo! - Why Logo Design Matters for Web Projects

Greetings! Here we are! Instead of having: **Meog** as a "logo", we have... this!

![Meog logo](/meog_logo.webp)

There was some thought behind this logo. First of all:

* Tried modifying the letters → too chaotic.
* Three letters are round; the first is from my name → could be useful later.
* Combine all letters into a single symbol → too hard to read.
* Light bulb-cat (idea + mascot) → not convincing.
* Light bulb with wires like a cat → looked like Wi-Fi + egg + lock, still too complex.
* Remove whiskers and ears → only a lock in an egg with Wi-Fi symbol remains.
* Focus on “meta” and dimensions → cube idea, but too abstract.
* Focus on the website → final logo is a browser with `<Meog/>`, a fake HTML tag.

The colors are cold neon to convey calm, tranquility, and a “tech” and “futuristic” feel. I really enjoy playing with lights.

I hope you like the logo that will be with us for a while! See you in the next post!
