## Welcome to Meog!

Howdy everyone! Thanks for being here!

I'm building this unique **"metablog"** because, as a web developer, I need to learn and stay updated. Beyond just studying, I also had to find a way to create a unique, substantial, valid, and interesting project that truly tests what I'm learning.

But just building something wasn't enough for me. I also wanted to teach myself and others throughout the process. That's why this is a **"metablog"**, a blog that grows and shares how it's made and what's behind it.

The entire project can be found on **GitHub**, so all the code is visible.

### Why a Metablog?

The language in the posts will be quite technical and is intended primarily for those who are curious about seeing an application "built in public," to see a story unfold during its creation, along with the technical choices behind something we're used to seeing or simply ignoring.

The metablog is intentionally "basic" and built one piece at a time, to show what's behind every single part (for example: you see an HTML page, but we can talk about **Accessibility**, **SEO**, **Semantic HTML**, **Core Web Vitals**, **Responsive Design**... even without actually "truly" building the metablog itself).

This experiment, in addition to being technical, will also be about **marketing and personal branding**. I'm excited to see how this experiment evolves, and how you evolve with it.

I truly hope you like Meog and learn as much as I am. Have a great day!
