## The Beauty of Sharing a Website

Have you ever searched something on Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo or another search engine? You type your words, and suddenly you see a list of websites: each with an icon, a title, and a short description.

Or maybe someone shared a website with you through a simple link. Alongside the link, you saw a preview image, a title, and a description. Both situations are possible thanks to **meta tags**.

### Generating Meta Tags

To generate the meta tags for each page of Meog, I used [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/). There I set the image to display when sharing a post, making every link to Meog look more visual and engaging.

### The Browser Icon: Favicon

I also created the small icon you see on the browser tab. This file is called *favicon.ico*, a 48Ã—48 image with a reduced version of the Meog logo. It is linked with the tag:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="[https://meog.it/favicon.ico](https://meog.it/favicon.ico)" />
```


With these small details, sharing your website becomes a much more pleasant and professional experience.
