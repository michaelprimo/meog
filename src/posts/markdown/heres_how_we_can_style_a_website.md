## Here's How We Can Style a Website

Welcome to a deep dive into styling Meog! Early versions of the site used standard CSS, but to keep the development fast and scalable, we opted for **Tailwind CSS**.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing classes like `.post-title-blue`, you apply utility classes directly in your HTML/JSX: `class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-500"`.

The main advantages are:

* **Speed:** No need to constantly switch between your CSS file and your component file.
* **Consistency:** The design system is enforced by the limited set of utility classes.
* **Scalability:** Changes are local to the component, reducing the risk of breaking other parts of the site.


### Configuration in Vite

Integrating Tailwind with **Vite** requires the correct PostCSS configuration, as detailed in a previous discussion. Once set up, the development experience becomes incredibly fluid.
