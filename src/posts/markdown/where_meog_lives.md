## Where Meog Lives

Did you know that every website has a “home”? To be visible worldwide, its pages and code must be stored on a computer connected to the Internet, called a **server**. This process is known as **hosting**.

### Choosing the Hosting: GitHub

For Meog I chose **GitHub**. Why?

- It’s free.
- It keeps track of every version (like an automatic backup).
- The code stays public, as in any open-source project.

### Going Live with Netlify

But that’s not enough. To make Meog ready for the future, I also use **Netlify**.

Netlify takes the site from GitHub and publishes it online, offering:

* Databases,
* Serverless functions,
* Automatic updates whenever the code changes.

### Domain Connection

Finally, I purchased the domain **meog.it** and linked it to Netlify. Don’t worry if you’re not an expert: the documentation guides you step by step.

That’s where Meog “lives” and why you can see it on your screen.
