                <p>Greetings! Here we are! Instead of having: <h1>Meog</h1> as a "logo", we have... this!</p>
                <img src="/img/meog_logo.png" alt="Meog logo" width="240" height="100">
                <p>There was some thought behind this logo. First of all:</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <ul>
                <li>Tried modifying the letters → too chaotic.</li>
                <li>Three letters are round; the first is from my name → could be useful later.</li>
                <li>Combine all letters into a single symbol → too hard to read.</li>
                <li>Light bulb-cat (idea + mascot) → not convincing.</li>
                <li>Light bulb with wires like a cat → looked like Wi-Fi + egg + lock, still too complex.</li>
                <li>Remove whiskers and ears → only a lock in an egg with Wi-Fi symbol remains.</li>
                <li>Focus on “meta” and dimensions → cube idea, but too abstract.</li>
                <li>Focus on the website → final logo is a browser with "&lt;Meog/&gt;", a fake HTML tag.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The colors are cool neon to convey calm, tranquility, and a “tech” and “futuristic” feel. I really enjoy playing with lights.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>I hope you like the logo that will be with us for a while! See you in the next post!</p>
