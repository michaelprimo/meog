                <section>
                    <p>Did you know that every website has a “home”? To be visible worldwide, its pages and code must be stored on a computer connected to the Internet, called a <strong>server</strong>. This process is known as <strong>hosting</strong>.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>For Meog I chose <strong>GitHub</strong>. Why?</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>It’s free.</li>
                    <li>It keeps track of every version (like an automatic backup).</li>
                    <li>The code stays public, as in any open-source project.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>But that’s not enough. To make Meog ready for the future, I also use <strong>Netlify</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Netlify takes the site from GitHub and publishes it online, offering:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Databases,</li>
                    <li>Serverless functions,</li>
                    <li>Automatic updates whenever the code changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>Finally, I purchased the domain <strong>meog.it</strong> and linked it to Netlify. Don’t worry if you’re not an expert: the documentation guides you step by step.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>That’s where Meog “lives” and why you can see it on your screen.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for reading! See you in the next post.</p>
