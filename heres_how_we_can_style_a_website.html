                    <p class="mb-5">Greetings and welcome to this new post on Meog! It has been a while!</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">In the early days of Meog, its construction was similar to the very first websites: plain text turned into HTML pages. 
                    HTML has default colors — white background, black text, blue links (purple once visited), and not much more.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">Over time, browsers evolved and CSS was born. 
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that works alongside HTML to customize the visual appearance of websites.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">Now you can see that the font has been changed — Courier New to give a more “typewriter” feel, and Helvetica, a font often used in tech websites. 
                    The site also features a neon–blue color palette, designed to convey calm and clarity. 
                    Articles are easier to read thanks to styled borders, proper spacing, and the use of padding and margins (all customizable through CSS).</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">Every element of a site (a button, a piece of text, or even the whole page) can be styled with CSS. 
                    That’s why you see larger headings, colored links, or even animations in the main menu when you hover and click. 
                    But relying only on CSS is not always enough.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">That’s why Meog also uses <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">TailwindCSS</a>, a framework (think of it as an “expansion pack” for CSS) that makes building user interfaces and experiences much easier.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">I hope you like the result so far! There’s still a lot to do, but this is just the beginning.</p>

                    <p>Wishing you a great evening and a wonderful weekend. 
                    Thanks for reading, and see you in the next post!</p>
