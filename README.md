# üò∏ Meog.it - The Metablog Which Grows with You! üò∏

**Meog** is a unique **metablog**: it hosts articles about web development, coding, and design of itself, other than being a "build-in-public" project that documents its entire technical construction process. The project serves as a practical demonstration of modern architectures, web performance, and advanced SEO optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Featured Technical Implementations

The following advanced implementations showcase my expertise in front-end engineering:

### **1. Extreme Performance (SSG)**

* **A-Grade on GTmetrix** with 100% Performance and 100% Structure.
* **Excellent Core Web Vitals:** LCP 528ms, TBT 0ms, CLS 0.
* Heavy use of **Server Components** to minimize client-side JavaScript.

### **2. Dynamic Content & MDX**

* Articles are statically generated by reading `.mdx` files from the `src/app/posts/markdown/` directory.
* Implementation of **`generateStaticParams()`** for static pre-generation of all articles during the build phase, ensuring instant loading times for readers.
* Custom **404 fallback** logic and handling of dynamic slug parameters (`[slug]/page.js`).

### **3. Advanced Technical SEO**

* **Structured Data:** Validated Schema.org JSON-LD injected for all articles, crucial for Rich Snippets.
* **Canonical Metadata Management:** Use of Next.js's `generateMetadata` function for dynamic injection of SEO metadata and canonical tags.
* **SEO Redirects (301):** Management of old URLs via `next.config.js` to preserve "link juice" and SEO authority during link migrations.
* **Crawl Management:** Configuration of the `robots.txt` file and sitemap for optimal Googlebot access.
