                        Howdy everyone! Thanks for being here!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm building this unique "metablog" because, as a web developer, I need to learn and stay updated. Beyond just studying, I also had to find a way to create a unique, substantial, valid, and interesting project that truly tests what I'm learning.
                        But just building something wasn't enough for me. I also wanted to teach myself and others throughout the process. That's why this is a "metablog",a blog that grows and shares how it's made and what's behind it.
                        The entire project can be found on GitHub, so all the code is visible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The language in the posts will be quite technical and is intended primarily for those who are curious about seeing an application "built in public," to see a story unfold during its creation, along with the technical choices behind something we're used to seeing or simply ignoring.
                        The metablog is intentionally "basic" and built one piece at a time, to show what's behind every single part (for example: you see an HTML page, but we can talk about accessibility, SEO, semantic HTML, Core Web Vitals, Responsive Design... without actually "truly" building the metablog itself).
                        This experiment, in addition to being technical, will also be about marketing and personal branding. I'm excited to see how this experiment evolves, and how you evolve with it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I truly hope you like Meog and learn as much as I am. Have a great day!
                    </p>
