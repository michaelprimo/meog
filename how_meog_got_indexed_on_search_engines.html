            <p class="mb-5">Howdy! Welcome to this post.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">When you put a website online, you expect it to immediately pop up on Google and other search engines... but getting noticed requires a bit of manual work instead.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">Currently, Meog is already showing up in major search results, thanks to a few essential tools and files. If you type the name "meog" into Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Ecosia, or Qwant, it's generally listed among the top three results.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-5">The initial visibility was achieved by directly communicating with the search engines:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li class="mb-5"><strong>Google Search Console (GSC):</strong> This tool was used to submit the site to Google, asking them to "crawl" (read) and index the pages.</li>
                <li class="mb-5"><strong>Bing Webmaster Tools (BWT):</strong> The same submission process was done on Bing. Submitting to Bing is a great strategy because it automatically helps smaller search engines find and index your site as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-5">Beyond direct submission, two critical files were created to facilitate the work of the search engine "bots":</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="mb-5"><strong><code>robots.txt</code></strong>: Created using a tool like <a href="https://www.seoptimer.com/robots-txt-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEOptimizer</a>, this file tells the crawlers which parts of the site they <strong>can</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> visit. It’s like a digital "Do Not Enter" sign for sensitive areas, ensuring the bots focus on the important content.</li>
                <li class="mb-5"><strong><code>sitemap.xml</code></strong>: Generated via a tool like <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XML-Sitemaps</a>, this file lists <strong>every single page</strong> on the site. It’s essentially a roadmap given directly to Google and Bing, ensuring no page is missed. The link to this file was submitted directly to both GSC and BWT.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="mb-5">By following these steps, your site will become visible to search engines as quickly as possible (usually within 48 hours for the initial operation).</p>
            
            <p class="mb-5"><strong>Thank you for reading this post. Have a great day!</strong></p>
